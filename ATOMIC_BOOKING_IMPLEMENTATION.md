# Atomic Booking Implementation - Preventing Double Bookings

## Overview
This implementation ensures that when a room is purchased/booked, the database properly tracks inventory and prevents double-booking through atomic operations and row-level locking.

## Key Components

### 1. Database Migration (`20250831_improve_booking_atomic_locking.sql`)
- **Pessimistic Locking**: Uses `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` to lock accommodation rows during booking creation
- **Atomic Operations**: All booking checks and creation happen within a single transaction
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Concurrent booking attempts are serialized

### 2. Main Functions

#### `create_booking_with_atomic_lock()`
- Locks the accommodation row before checking availability
- Counts existing bookings while holding the lock
- Creates new booking only if inventory is available
- Returns booking ID on success, raises exception if no availability

#### `check_availability_with_lock()`
- Provides real-time availability count
- Considers both confirmed and pending bookings
- Returns 0 if no rooms available, 9999 for unlimited accommodations

#### `assign_accommodation_item_atomically()`
- Assigns specific room items to bookings
- Uses `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to handle concurrent assignments
- Ensures no two bookings get the same room item

### 3. Edge Function Updates (`create-booking-securely/index.ts`)
- Modified to use the new `create_booking_with_atomic_lock` RPC call
- Better error handling for availability issues
- Clear user-facing messages when rooms are fully booked

## How It Works

1. **User attempts to book a room**
2. **Backend calls `create_booking_with_atomic_lock`**
3. **Function locks the accommodation row** (other bookings wait)
4. **Checks current bookings against inventory**
5. **If available**: Creates booking and releases lock
6. **If not available**: Raises exception with clear message
7. **Lock is released**, next booking attempt proceeds

## Benefits

- **No Double Bookings**: Impossible for two users to book the last available room
- **Real-time Accuracy**: Inventory counts are always accurate
- **Better User Experience**: Clear messages when rooms are unavailable
- **Performance**: Optimized indexes for fast availability checks
- **Monitoring**: Built-in function to detect any double-booking issues

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the implementation:
```sql
psql -d your_database -f test-atomic-booking.sql
```

## Monitoring

Check for any double-bookings (should return empty):
```sql
SELECT * FROM check_for_double_bookings();
```

## Rollback

If needed, the original booking behavior can be restored by:
1. Removing the new migration
2. Reverting the Edge Function changes
3. Running: `DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS create_booking_with_atomic_lock CASCADE;`
